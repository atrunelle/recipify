# Recipify application

In order to compare FE frameworks and keep myself updated with latest technologies, I choose to make the same application using different techniques and frameworks: 
- Vue
- Angular 2+
- React
- Vanilla (soon)

## Features
The application purpose is to be able to create recipes by searching for ingreadients and comparing the nutritional content of each ingredients.

## Material design
In order to focus purely on the logic, and not have to design the app from scratch (I am not a designer), I choose to use material design using the offical material design (or more popular) for each framework. 

## Testing
Each of those applications are fully unit tested or in the process to be. I didn't use TDD as for some, I was learning the framework at the time, and prefered to leave testing complexity the framework can bring apart.
