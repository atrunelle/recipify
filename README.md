# Recipify application

Simple recipe creator app built with Vue.

## Features
The application purpose is to be able to create recipes by searching for ingredients and comparing the nutritional content of each ingredient.

## Material design
In order to focus purely on the logic, and not have to design the app from scratch (I am not a designer), I choose to use material design using the official material design (or more popular) for each framework.

## Testing
Each of those applications is fully unit tested or in the process to be. I didn't use TDD as for some, I was learning the framework at the time, and preferred to leave testing complexity the framework can bring apart.
