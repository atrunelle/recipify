# Recipify application

In order to compare FE frameworks and keep myself updated with latest technologies, I choose to make the same application using different techniques and frameworks: 
- [Vue](https://github.com/atrunelle/recipify/tree/master/vuejs)
- [Angular 2+](https://github.com/atrunelle/recipify/tree/master/angular)
- [React](https://github.com/atrunelle/recipify/tree/master/react)

They all use stores using Vuex, NgRx and Redux for the only purpose to show how I would structure a large application to allow it to scale, even though it might be overkill in the case of this simple app.

## Features
The application purpose is to be able to create recipes by searching for ingredients and comparing the nutritional content of each ingredient.

## Material design
In order to focus purely on the logic, and not have to design the app from scratch (I am not a designer), I choose to use material design using the official material design (or more popular) for each framework. 

## Testing
Each of those applications is fully unit tested or in the process to be. I didn't use TDD as for some, I was learning the framework at the time, and preferred to leave testing complexity the framework can bring apart.
